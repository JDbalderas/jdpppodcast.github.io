                        Diego is a brilliant handsome young man who has a great appreciation for video games. "Video games have been my biggest inspiration for everything I do for as I can remember. I have grown up playing video games with friends and family and while I enjoy doing such what is more important to me is the larger impacts it has had on my life and how it shaped me to become who I am. I have always loved creating things if that would be through drawing or something else. I've loved to draw since I was a little a kid and almost everything I drew would relate to games I liked. If it weren't for video games, I would have never gotten into making music or programming. Games have been the catalyst for everything I make in my life.‚Äù
